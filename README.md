# RedditNHLStreams
A nice, easy-to-use method of accessing NHL Streams supplied by Reddit users.

/r/RedditNHLStreams provides a means for users to provide NHL Streams for others.
However, the process to access a stream is rather cumbersome; the user must navigate
to the subreddit, select the game that they're interested in watching, and then select 
a stream. This service often provides youtube streams to the games that are hosted by 
users, so I decided to design a simple front end that serves the urls from these 
youtube streams.

Once the product is complete, a url will be provided.
